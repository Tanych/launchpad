{"name":"Launchpad","google":"","body":"### About launchpad and the GW Findit Project\r\nLaunchpad uses our catalog, journals, and databases to make it easier to get to what you're looking for and to give you a way to get what you need, even if it's not readily available at GW or our consortium peer libraries. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Summary information is provided for each work (title, author, standard numbers)\r\n* All of our WRCL consortium holdings are listed for a selected title, grouped by institution and library location\r\n* Real time availability is displayed -- based on live query of three different library systems (WRLC, Georgetown, George Mason)\r\n* Associated records from all members libraries based on standard numbers (ISBN, ISSN, OCLC) are retrieved\r\n* Conditional logic for consortium borrowing is applied to the items found (for example a Reference book or an item Charged is not eligible)\r\n* Links are provided to the Consortium loan request form and to an Interlibrary Loan Request form, as appropriate\r\n* Book jacket thumbnail images from OpenLibrary.org are displayed, when available\r\n* Non-Roman script (unicode for Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and other languages) is displayed whenever appropriate\r\n* Links are provided enabling the user to send item information as text or by email\r\n* Standard URL patterns provide access from Worldcat, Google, and local catalogs based upon standard numbers (Bibliographic / Item ID, ISBN, ISSN, and OCLC)\r\n* Site pages are being indexed by Google; users may search in Google to locate library holdings\r\n* Many titles held outside of the consortium are available via an Interlibrary Loan forms (via the GoogleBooks API and WorldCat API)\r\n* Links are provided to full text of books available from Open Library (based on LCCN lookup in the Open Library API)\r\n* Online journal titles include the date range (as provided by the Serials Solutions 360 Link API)\r\n* Customizeable user interface uses CSS in order to follow the general look and feel of the library web site\r\n\r\n\r\n### GW Findit environment\r\nWe build launchpad at GW Libraries to bring together information from three separate integrated library systems:\r\n* Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC): ExLibris Voyager ILS\r\n* Georgetown University: Innovative Interfaces Millenium ILS\r\n* George Mason University: ExLibris Voyager ILS\r\n\r\nThe WRLC Voyager ILS is a _union_ catalog. It is used to maintain bibliographic, holding, and item information by most members of the library consortium. These institutions are listed here with the approximate number of titles held by each:\r\n\r\n* American University (1,300,000)\r\n* Catholic University (860,000)\r\n* Gallaudet University (400,000)\r\n* George Washington University (1,700,000)\r\n* Howard University (760,000)\r\n* Marymount University (185,000)\r\n* University of the District of Columbia (575,000)\r\n\r\nIn addition, the WRLC Voyager ILS stores a copy of bibliographic information provided by two other local institutions that maintain their own ILS:\r\n\r\n* George Mason University (1,750,000)\r\n* Georgetown University (2,740,000)\r\n\r\nThe Voyager ILS hosted by WRLC does not have the holdings and items from the other two sytems. In order to obtain detailed holding and circulation status for George Mason and Georgetown it is necessary to query those systems directly. \r\n\r\n\r\n### The Findit programming environment\r\nThe Findit project is **Python** and **Django** based application.  It assumes the presence of a primary Voyager/Oracle database, with direct read-only access using Oracle's SQL Plus client.  At present, it has no separate application database of its own, and it does not write data to Oracle.\r\n\r\nWe recommend developing, testing, and deploying launchpad in a virtualenv.  Instructions and requirements are in the [README](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/launchpad/blob/master/README.md).\r\n\r\nLaunchpad optimizes the interactions with the integrated library systems by minimizing the number of database roundtrips with direct SQL queries.  We run it in production at GW Libraries with memcached page caching (as provided by django) enabled. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### How Findit obtains real time availability\r\nThe Findit program runs in a Linux environment hosted at the WRLC facilities. Findit uses Oracle **SQLPlus InstantClient** software on this server to execute SQL queries against the WRLC Voyager Oracle database using a read-only user account. When a title is held by Georgetown or George Mason, Findit executes **Z39.50** queries against the appropriate remote database. The application collates the responses and generates a web page or JSON data structure.\r\n\r\n### Findit API\r\n#### Link patterns in Findit\r\nThe standard URL for any item in findit is its WRLC Voyager database bibliographic identifier, or \"bib id\". Every request to Findit should result in a URL like this: \r\n\r\n[http://findit.library.gwu.edu/item/3992408](http://findit.library.gwu.edu/item/3992408)\r\nIn this example, 3992408 is the bib id. \r\n\r\nStandard identifiers like ISBN, ISSN, and OCLC also have link patterns\r\n\r\n[http://findit.library.gwu.edu/isbn/0439136350](http://findit.library.gwu.edu/isbn/0439136350)\r\n\r\n[http://findit.library.gwu.edu/issn/0000-0019](http://findit.library.gwu.edu/issn/0000-0019)\r\n\r\n[http://findit.library.gwu.edu/oclc/00162792](http://findit.library.gwu.edu/oclc/00162792)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Data Raw data from findit in JSON\r\nJust add \".json\" to the end of any /item/[bib id] URL: \r\n\r\n[http://findit.library.gwu.edu/item/3992408.json](http://findit.library.gwu.edu/item/3992408.json)\r\n\r\nIn the JSON, basic bibliographic data is at the top level, and separate holdings data is listed one by one. \r\n\r\n_We are actively refactoring / improving the source. The JSON structure is subject to change._\r\n\r\n\r\n### Indexing\r\n#### Schema.org\r\nThe Findit pages contain semantic markup compatible with standards established by [schema.org](http://schema.org/CreativeWork).\r\n\r\n#### Google site index\r\nContent from the Findit project is gradually being index with the Google site index tool. This indexing is progressing at the rate of a few thousand titles per day. There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 million titles in the WLRC collection. Searching a title and the phrase \"gwu libraries\" will yield search results that link to Findit by the item identifier.\r\n\r\nFor example search\r\n```data mining gwu libraries```\r\n\r\nEnabling the configuration setting ```ENABLE_SITEMAPS``` will expose all the non-suppressed item URLs in the catalog to crawlers using the sitemaps specification.\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\nLaunchpad is free software under an MIT-style license.
